Welcome to Sol-OS, a Unix-inspired operating system.
Kernel version 0.1

** PLEASE READ **
If you type a command that does not exist, the system will reboot automatically.
If you do a 'cd ..', please check whether the current directory you are on
actually has the '..' entry in it.  If it does not, the system will crash.
If you don't see the '..' entry, just do a 'cd' with an absolute address instead.

These are just a few bugs to be aware of. I will fix them as soon as I can.
All the usual  Unix commands live in ‘/usr/bin’.
Only a few typical Unix commands have been implemented so far.

A few programs are in '/usr/local/bin' and ‘/usr/local/games’.

There is no Vi/Vim (yet).  The only editor available here is Ed,
and a very limited version of it.
You can learn how to use Ed by checking the man pages.
Do a ‘man ed’ to bring up the manual for Ed.
This version of Ed is very early and limited, and will only be capable of
printing and deleting ranges of lines, as well as appending text at the end of
the file only. I am still working on it :).

Thank you for visiting
