NAME
    ed - line-oriented text editor

SYNOPSIS
    ed [file]

DESCRIPTION
    ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display, 
    modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via shell
    scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in the current
    directory and cannot execute shell commands. Ed is the 'standard' text
    editor in the sense that it is the original editor for Unix, and thus widely available.

    This version of ed is very simplified and is being written from scratch slowly.
