00   +offset     ( +1 for sequential, and +offset for cond/uncond jumps )
01   branch      ( used for microcode branches, which are used to perform programmer's branches as well )
10   pre         ( pre-fetch, means next is the pre-fetch microcode )
11   post        ( means next u-address is given by  0xIR000000, u-code length = 64 places(6bits) )
