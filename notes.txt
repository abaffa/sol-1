21Feb2023:	When the kernel forks a new process, it pushes a byte for the status register. That has the DISPLAY_REGS_LOAD flag = 0.
		So if that flag was 1 before the fork it will be set to 0 during the execution of that process, and then recovered later.
		I saw this "bug" a year after not working on Sol-1 and wondered what caused it. Added this note so I don't forget again.
